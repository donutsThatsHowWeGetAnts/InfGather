NAME
    infGather - Script to gather information for a given IP or
		the given octect triple (i.e. 10.11.1).

SYNOPSIS
    infGather [-i] IP/Octect Triple [options...]

DESCRIPTION
     infGather gathers information about the given IP or octect
     triple. It uses nmap, dirb, nikto, enum4linux, etc. to coll-
     ect and capture useful information. The information is stor-
     ed in the /$USER/program/IP/ directory, where the program
     could be nmap/dirb/etc. By default, there are configuration 
     options that are set. Configuration options like, the word 
     list to use, max time to sleep, etc. To display more details
     use -h or --help. 

OPTIONS

     -f, --file		
          Read a file of IPs instead of scanning for alive boxes

     -h, --help		
          Help information

[**] -i, --ip		
          The IP triple to scan or the full IP to scan 
          (i.e. 10.11.1 OR 10.11.1.1)

     -m, --max		
          Maximum parallel processes to run 
          (Default is set to 12)

     -p, --perm		
          Install infGather so that it can be run from anywhere.
          Install man page and bash completion

     -s, --single		
          Scan a single IP address

     -w, --wlist		
          Wordlist to use 
          (Default will be infGatherWordList.txt)

     -z, --ztime		
          Maximum sleep time between checking if PID completed
          (Default is set to 5s)

FILES
     /$USER/program/IP/
          The location of the collection of output from the given
          program. The program could be nmap, nikto, etc. For ex-
          ample, if it was nmap the direction location would be 
          /$USER/nmap/IP/. 

EXAMPLES 

     infGather -s 10.11.1.24
          Single scan of the IP 10.11.1.24, using the default
          word list.

     infGather -i 10.11.1 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
          Ping sweep to determine what IPs are "alive", scan the 
          "alive" IPs, using the word list /usr/share/wordlists/-
          dirb/common.txt

     infGather -f ips.txt -m 20 -z 3
          Scan the IPs within the ips.txt file, setting max paral-
          lel processes to 20, sleep time to 3s, using the default
          word list.
